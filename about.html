I am a lawyer and a PhD student in criminology with a deep passion for understanding the intersection of law and society. My research focuses on law and public policy, where I explore how legal systems impact societal outcomes and contribute to policy development. With my background in both legal practice and academic research, I am committed to contributing to meaningful discussions and advancing knowledge in the areas of criminal justice reform, legal theory, and policy analysis.
